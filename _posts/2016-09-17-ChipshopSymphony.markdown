We recorded a full orchestra for this east London sunrise to a one note symphony.

Chipshop Symphony is a video installation by director Adam Leiber and was made to be viewable across six large screens. Unfortunately that means it doesnâ€™t translate well to a Vimeo upload.

The film was commissioned by Keith Khan & Associates for an exhibition at Lille 3000 in December 2010.
