Ident sequences created by Non-Format for Visuelt, the annual Norwegian design award show.

We made around 10 pieces of music like this among other bits. Watch more [here](vimeo.com/album/1873779/ "Visuelt 2011").

We also wrote extra pieces to be used on an hour-long behind-the-scenes documentary on the festival made by BLVK and Grafil. Watch it [here](vimeo.com/25223891 "BLVK").
