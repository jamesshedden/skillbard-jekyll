Music &amp; sound design created for Visuelt, Norwayâ€™s annual design awards. Each of these pieces were played during the awards ceremony and seminars to introduce award categories and guest speakers.

I worked with classical soprano Eleanor Ross and vocal artist Jennifer Walshe to create one, rather erratic voice.

I also wrote and performed live two original pieces with Eleanor Ross at the ceremony in Oslo.
