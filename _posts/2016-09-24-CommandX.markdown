Part of the AIGA National Design Conference in Minneapolis, Command X is a game show that does for graphic design what Project Runway does for fashion.

These three title sequences, created by Non-Format, kick off each day of the competition and feature a Skillbard remix of Command Xâ€™s original theme. Non-Format asked me to bring the old guitar-driven power-pop tune into the next century with this slap-heavy proto-funk rendition. We were only too happy to oblige.
